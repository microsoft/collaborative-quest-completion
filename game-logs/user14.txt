[Chat] Player: Hello Elena, what useful resources are available in the nearby area?
[Chat] Elena: In the nearby area, we have oak trees for wood, cobblestones, and dirt. There's also a chest not far from here that contains a stone pickaxe and some cobblestones.
[Chat] Player: What resources do I need to make a stone pickaxe?
[Goal] : Gather cobblestones and wood to create a stone pickaxe for the player.
[Chat] Elena: To make a stone pickaxe, you'll need 3 cobblestones and 2 wooden sticks. You can gather cobblestones by mining stone blocks, and you can make wooden sticks by crafting planks from wood logs and then crafting sticks from the planks.
[Chat] Player: Do I need a pickaxe to mine the cobblestone?
[Chat] Elena: Yes, you'll need a pickaxe to mine the cobblestone effectively. If you don't have one, I can give you the stone pickaxe from the chest nearby. Would you like me to do that?

[Chat] Player: I have sticks, how would I make a pickaxe?
[Chat] Elena: To make a stone pickaxe, first, open your crafting table interface. Place one wooden stick in the center slot and another stick in the slot below it. Then, place one cobblestone in each of the top row slots. This will create a stone pickaxe.
[Chat] Player: I do not have cobblestone in my inventory.
[Chat] Elena: No worries! I can guide you to the nearest cobblestone source for mining. Follow me!
[Chat] Elena: I've found the nearest cobblestone source. Come with me, and I'll show you where it is.
[Equipped] Player: Crafting Table
[Equipped] Player: Wooden Pickaxe
[Chat] Player: I apologize, I have made a crafting table which reveals how to make a wooden pickaxe. I have done this already.
