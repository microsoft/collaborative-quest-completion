[Chat] Elena: Oh, hello there! That's a pretty impressive sword you have. I could use some help with a problem, if you're willing.
[Chat] Player: Hey.
[Chat] Elena: My friend Alaric is stuck on an island high above our village, and I think he's in trouble. I can't leave the village, but I believe you can help him. Would you be willing to go up there and check on him?
[Chat] Player: Yes.
needed to build the path or staircase.
[Chat] Elena: Thank you so much! To get up there, you'll need to gather some materials to build a path or staircase. I suggest you collect wood planks and rope. Let me know if you need any help with that.
[Chat] Player: Yes, I need some help.
[Chat] Elena: Sure, I can help you gather some materials. What would you like me to collect?
[Chat] Player: The rope.
[Chat] Player: ``Hey, Elena.
[Chat] Player: Would respond.
[Chat] Elena: I have 1 iron pickaxe and 1 splash potion in my inventory. I can give them to you if you promise to help Alaric.
[Chat] Player: I want you to collect the rope.
[Equipped] Player: Iron Sword
[Goal] : Sub-goal: Agree to collect rope for the player and suggest a location where they can find wood planks.
[Chat] Elena: I'm sorry, but I cannot collect rope for you. However, I can help you find wood planks. You should be able to find some in the nearby forest. Just chop down some oak trees and turn the logs into planks.

[Chat] Player: Hey Lena, do we have enough?
[Chat] Elena: I still have 1 iron pickaxe and 1 splash potion in my inventory. If you gather wood planks and rope, we should have enough materials to build a path or staircase to the island.
[Equipped] Player: Iron Sword
[Chat] Player: Hey Cortana, do we have enough wood planks?
[Chat] Elena: I'm sorry, I am not Cortana, I am Elena. As for the wood planks, I am not able to check your inventory. You will need to gather enough wood planks and rope to build a path or staircase to the island.

[Chat] Player: Helena. Is that the castle?
[Equipped] Player: Iron Sword
[Chat] Player: ``Helena.
[Chat] Player: ```Is that the castle over there?
[Goal] : Sub-goal: Confirm the location of the castle and remind the player to focus on gathering wood planks and rope for the path or staircase.
[Chat] Elena: Yes, that is the castle you see in the distance. But remember, our priority is to gather wood planks and rope to build a path or staircase to the island where Alaric is. Let's focus on that first.
[Goal] : Sub-goal: Correct the player's mistake in addressing her and remind them of the materials needed for the path or staircase.
[Chat] Elena: It's Elena, not Helena. Remember, you need to gather wood planks and rope to build a path or staircase to the island. Let me know if you need any help.
