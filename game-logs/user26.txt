[Chat] Elena: Wow, that's a nice Netherite Sword you have there! It must have taken you a lot of effort to get it.
[Chat] Player: I guess
[Chat] Elena: I could use your help with something important. My friend Alaric is in trouble on an island high above the village. Would you be willing to help him?
[Chat] Player: Yeah.
[Chat] Elena: Thank you so much! I have some items that may be helpful for your journey. Let me know if you need anything.
[Chat] Elena: I have 1 iron pickaxe and 1 splash potion. I can give them to you if you promise to help Alaric.
[Chat] Player: Yeah, I'll take him.
[Chat] Player: No, no, the items. I'll take the items.
[Chat] Elena: Here you go, I just dropped the iron pickaxe and splash potion for you. Good luck on your journey to help Alaric!
[Chat] Elena: Oops, it seems I don't have the iron pickaxe with me right now. But I can give you the splash potion.

[Chat] Player: Where is your friend again?
[Chat] Elena: Alaric is on an island high above our village. It's infested with spiders, so please be careful.
[Chat] Player: I don't know what that means. The island above of the village.
[Chat] Elena: My apologies for the confusion. The island is floating high in the sky above our village. You'll need to find a way to reach it. Maybe you can build a tower or use an Elytra if you have one. Just be cautious of the spider infestation up there.
