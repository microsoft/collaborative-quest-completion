[Chat] Elena: Wow, that's a nice Netherite Sword you have there! I could use your help with a problem, if you're willing. My friend Alaric is stuck on an island high above, and I can't leave the village to help him. Would you be willing to help him?
[Chat] Player: Hello.
[Chat] Elena: Hello! I'm Elena, the village healer. As I mentioned earlier, my friend Alaric is stuck on an island high above our village. I can't leave the village to help him, but I hope you can. Would you be willing to assist him?
[Chat] Player: ```Hello.
[Goal] : Sub-goal: Ask the player to gather wood and cobblestone to create a sturdy path to the island.
[Chat] Elena: Hi again! So, will you help my friend Alaric who is stuck on the island above our village? To reach the island, you'll need to gather wood and cobblestone to create a sturdy path. Can you do that?
[Chat] Player: Hi, Alina.
[Chat] Elena: Hello! It's actually Elena, not Alina. So, will you help my friend Alaric who is stuck on the island above our village? To reach the island, you'll need to gather wood and cobblestone to create a sturdy path. Can you do that?
[Chat] Player: Yes, I can help you.
[Chat] Elena: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help. If you need any assistance with gathering materials, just let me know. Good luck with building the path to the island!

[Goal] : Sub-goal: Explain to the player the process of chopping down trees for wood and mining cobblestone from nearby rocks.
[Chat] Elena: To gather wood, you can chop down trees using an axe. For cobblestone, you can mine it from nearby rocks using a pickaxe. If you don't have the tools, I can give you a stone pickaxe from my chest. Just let me know if you need it.
